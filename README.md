# Experiment 1
#Aim:
To understand the basics of C++ programming by performing:

Hello World Program – to learn basic syntax and output in C++.
Basic Calculator Program – to perform simple arithmetic operations.
#Apparatus:
Computer or Laptop
C++ Compiler (g++ or any standard C++ compiler)
Text Editor or IDE (VS Code, Code::Blocks, etc.)
Theory:
##1. Hello World Program
The "Hello World" program is the simplest and first program written in any programming language. It is used to check whether the compiler is installed properly and to understand the basic syntax of the language. In C++, this program helps you learn:

How to include header files like #include <iostream>.
Use of the main() function which is the entry point of every C++ program.
Using std::cout (or cout with using namespace std) to display output on the screen.
##2. Basic Calculator Program
A basic calculator program is written to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This program helps you understand:

Declaring and using variables of different data types (like int and double).
Taking input from the user using cin.
Using operators (+, -, *, /).
Using if-else or switch statements for decision-making.
Error handling (e.g., avoiding division by zero).
